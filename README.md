## Underwriting Strategy

Potential underwriting strategies are based on preliminary data analysis, data insights, and domain research. Detailed documentation can be found in the [strategy_definition/strategy.md](strategy_definition/strategy.md).

## Data Collection & Analysis

Creating synthetic data to mimic real-world lending scenarios and performing exploratory data analysis to understand key patterns and insights. See the `data/` and `eda/` folders for more details.

## Risk Determination

A risk model to score each user's lending risk. The methodology and code can be found in the `risk_model/` directory.

## Reporting

Reports highlighting key findings, patterns, and recommendations. These can be found in the `reporting/` folder.

## Policy Drafting

Based on the insights and risk determination, we've drafted a set of hypothetical underwriting policies to guide lending decisions. Refer to [policies/draft_policies.md](policies/draft_policies.md).

## Additional Data Sources

Discussion on potential external data sources to enhance the underwriting decision process is integrated into the project overview.

## Product Recommendations

Insights and suggestions on product features or fixes grounded on data analysis are located in `product_recommendations/`.

## SQL Demonstrations

For data manipulation and querying, SQL scripts demonstrating potential real-world usage have been added to `sql_demonstrations/`.
